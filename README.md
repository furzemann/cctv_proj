## üìù Overview

Standard object trackers often fail in real-world scenarios due to frequent occlusions, erratic motion, and changes in appearance, leading to fragmented tracks and identity switches. This project implements a sophisticated tracking pipeline designed to overcome these challenges.

By integrating *Ultralytics YOLOv8* for rapid detection, a *Part-Based ResNet50* model for robust visual identification, a *Kalman Filter* for smooth motion prediction, and the *Hungarian Algorithm* for optimal data association, our system provides a highly effective and scalable solution for real-world person tracking. Advanced logic such as adaptive smoothing, safe re-attachment gating, and fallback IoU matching is incorporated to ensure tracking continuity and reliability.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* *‚ö° High-Speed Detection: Leverages the state-of-the-art **Ultralytics YOLOv8* model for an exceptional balance of speed and accuracy, ideal for real-time analysis.
* *üõ° Robust Re-Identification (Re-ID): Creates a powerful visual signature by extracting features from **3 horizontal body parts* (head, torso, legs) using a ResNet50 model. This part-based approach is more resilient to partial occlusions and appearance changes than global feature methods.
* *üìà Smooth Motion Prediction: Employs a **Kalman Filter* for each track to model its motion state, predict future positions, and seamlessly bridge temporary detection gaps.
* *ü§ù Optimal Data Association: Utilizes the **Hungarian Algorithm* to globally minimize assignment cost (a weighted sum of visual and spatial distance), preventing sub-optimal local matches and ensuring logical track-to-detection pairing.
* *üß† Advanced Heuristics*:
    * *Safe Re-attachment Gating*: Implements strict criteria (high visual similarity, spatial proximity, and recentness) to prevent incorrect track re-identifications after a person is lost.
    * *Fallback IoU Matching*: Prioritizes spatial continuity by re-attaching tracks based on spatial overlap for short-term misses, effectively preventing the creation of duplicate IDs.
    * *Adaptive Bounding Box Smoothing*: Dynamically adjusts the smoothing factor based on object velocity to provide stable, jitter-free boxes for slow-moving targets and responsive boxes for fast-moving ones.
* *üìä Actionable Outputs*: Generates both a processed video with annotated tracks and a detailed, frame-by-frame text log for comprehensive post-analysis.

## ‚öô System Pipeline

Our system processes video through a multi-stage pipeline designed for maximum accuracy and resilience.


1.  *Video Input*: The system receives a live or pre-recorded video stream.
2.  *YOLO Detection*: An Ultralytics YOLO model scans each frame to identify all persons, generating bounding boxes and confidence scores. Detections with confidence above a set threshold are passed to the next stage.
3.  *Part-Based Feature Extraction*: For each valid detection, a ResNet50 model extracts unique visual features from the head, torso, and legs to create a robust, occlusion-resistant appearance signature.
4.  *Motion Prediction*: A Kalman Filter assigned to each existing track predicts its next location based on its current motion state (position and velocity).
5.  *Association & Matching*: A cost matrix is constructed based on a weighted sum of visual similarity (Cosine Distance) and spatial proximity (IoU) between predicted tracks and new detections. The Hungarian Algorithm solves this matrix to find the optimal assignments.
6.  *State Update & Refinement*: Matched tracks are updated with new detection data, and their bounding boxes are smoothed. Unmatched detections may initiate new tracks.
7.  *Output & Logging*: The final output is rendered, including a processed video with annotated tracks and a detailed text log file for analysis.

## üíª Hardware Requirements & Performance

For optimal performance, specific hardware is recommended. The tracker's computational speed (FPS) is highly dependent on the system's hardware, the video resolution, and the density of objects being tracked.

### Hardware
* *GPU: An NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU is **highly recommended* for real-time performance.
    * *Recommended*: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM) or higher.
    * *Minimum*: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB VRAM).
    * The system can run on a *CPU*, but performance will be significantly slower (typically < 5 FPS) and is not suitable for real-time applications.
* *System RAM*: 16 GB or more.
* *Storage*: SSD for faster video I/O.

### Performance Estimation
This system does not require training; it performs inference using pre-trained models. The processing time is therefore the time it takes to run the pipeline on each frame of the video.

To estimate the total time required to process a video, you can use the following formula:

$$
\text{Total Processing Time (seconds)} = \frac{\text{Total Video Frames}}{\text{Inference FPS}}
$$

*Example Calculation:*
* *Video*: 5 minutes long at 30 frames per second.
* *Total Frames*: $5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 30 \text{ frames/second} = 9000 \text{ frames}$.
* *Your System's FPS*: Let's assume your GPU achieves an average of 45 FPS during processing.
* *Estimated Time*: $ \frac{9000 \text{ frames}}{45 \text{ FPS}} = 200 \text{ seconds} \approx 3.3 \text{ minutes}$.

You can find your system's inference FPS from the console output while the script is running.

Note on PyTorch: For GPU support, ensure you install the correct version of PyTorch that corresponds to your CUDA version. It is highly recommended to follow the official instructions at the PyTorch website.

4. Prepare Input Video
Place your input video file (e.g., in .mp4 format) in the root of the project directory. The script is configured by default to look for a file named input_video.mp4.

‚ñ∂ Execution
